# System Architecture Diagram

The architecture of the Raff Tool is designed to be scalable, resilient, and maintainable. Below is a high-level overview of the system components and their interactions.

## Components
- **Payment API**: Handles payment processing requests and integrates with external payment gateways.
- **Data Engine**: Processes CSV files and aggregates data in real-time.
- **Notification Service**: Listens for events and sends notifications based on payment processing results.
- **Data Store**: MongoDB is used for persistent storage of user and payment data.
- **Redis Cache**: Used for session management and caching to improve performance.

## Considerations
- The architecture supports horizontal scaling, allowing for multiple instances of services behind a load balancer.
- Event-driven communication via RabbitMQ ensures reliable message delivery and decouples services.
