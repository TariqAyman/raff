# Distributed Caching

## Overview
Distributed caching is implemented in the Raff Tool using Redis to enhance performance and manage session data effectively. This document outlines the caching strategy and its benefits.

## Caching Strategy
- **Session Management**: User sessions are stored in Redis to allow for quick access and management.
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis is used to track request counts per user/IP, enabling dynamic rate limiting.
- **Data Caching**: Frequently accessed data, such as user roles and permissions, are cached to reduce database load.

## Benefits
- **Performance Improvement**: Caching reduces the number of database queries, leading to faster response times.
- **Scalability**: Redis can handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it suitable for high-traffic applications.
- **Fault Tolerance**: In the event of a database failure, cached data can still be served, improving system resilience.

## Implementation
- Redis is initialized at application startup and used throughout the application for caching purposes.
- Cache keys are generated based on user IDs and request parameters to ensure uniqueness.
- Cache expiration policies are set to ensure stale data is purged regularly.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.
- Explore Redis clustering for improved scalability and fault tolerance.
